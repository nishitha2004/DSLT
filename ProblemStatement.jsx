      <p>
        Speech- and hearing-impaired individuals face difficulties communicating
         with normal people.Their communication is mainly visual, while normal people 
         rely on auditory cues.Most people do not understand sign language, creating a 
         major communication gap.Current solutions are often expensive or require complex 
         wearable devices.<br/>
         There is a need for a simple system that can capture hand 
         gestures using a camera and convert them into text and speech in real time.
         Such a system would make communication easier and reduce misunderstandings 
         between the two communities.<br/>
         This project aims to empower speech- and
         hearing-impaired people by enabling seamless interaction through gesture-to-text 
         and voice translation.                                                                                              convert the above information  into 4 to 5 points for the problem statement.
